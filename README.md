# Web-Scrapping-Data-Wraggling-and-Cleaning
Part 1: Segmenting and Clustering Neighbourhoods in Toronto. 

In the first part of this project, I showcase codes developed to scrap list of postal codes, boroughs and neighbourhoods in Toronto from the wikipedia webpage.
[Wikepedia Webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M)
For webscraping, i made use of the BeautifulSoup python library

I also transformed the scraped data to a structured dataframe using the Pandas python library

I carried out data wranling and cleaning to make the data useable for further analysis
